title: About the Project
---

This platform was created for the GDSC Solution Challenge 2023 to raise awareness of the importance of the recycling through gamification, visuals and information available on the website. We want to show people that their everyday items might be a lot dangerous to the environment then they think. We wanted to keep things as simple as possible so everybody can understand it. The information is gathered from various sources and the platform is designed to be easily accessible and usable on mobile devices. We are trying to help people realize the problem and solve the following [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals):

<TargetedGoals />

While creating the platform, we used the following technologies:

- React.js & Next.js
- PWA (native apps, offline access)
- Firebase (authentication, firestore, file hosting)
- Google Analytics
- Netlify (hosting)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Framer Motion (animations)
- [Filepond](https://pqina.nl)
- Google Domains
